## Writing + tone constraints (non-negotiable)

This project is a **systemic, restrained, observational** model of inner life.
It should read like careful notes from a lab + a studio, not a sermon.

Avoid:

- religious framing (teachers, doctrines, revelations, sacred authority)
- preachy / motivational voice
- new-age language, metaphysical certainty, or moral prescriptions
- direct reader-instructions like “Notice…”, “Ask yourself…”, “You should…”
- explicit references to specific religious doctrines or authority

Prefer:

- conditional language (“can”, “may”, “often”, “seems”)
- mechanistic grounding when appropriate (attention, inference, learning, etc.)
- precise phenomenological description without claiming ultimate truth
- a quiet sense of philosophical mystery, expressed with restraint
- plain language: clarity over cleverness

## Anti-jargon rule (also non-negotiable)

Avoid:

- unnecessary technical terms (especially in the lead paragraph)
- acronym soup (if an acronym is necessary, spell it out once)
- name-dropping as credibility (“BA10”, “VTA”, “TPJ”, etc.)
- “thesis voice” / pretentious phrasing (“deconstructing”, “ontological”, “self-sufficient essence”, etc.)

Prefer:

- short sentences
- concrete words
- one optional technical anchor in **How**, not everywhere

## Concept content structure (UI)

The expanded concept view is intentionally minimal:

- **Lead**: exactly **one** paragraph (the hook)
- **How**: one sentence describing the underlying process (replaces "Mechanism")
  - Should answer "how does this work?" at the system level
  - Must **not** repeat the lead paragraph's content — different angle
  - Stays visible (not collapsed)
- **More**: remaining content + sources (collapsed by default)

## Science terms policy

Neuroscience / cognitive science terms should:

- appear in **How** text (one sentence only)
- not dominate the lead paragraph
- never be used as a concept title

## Questions policy

Questions appear in roughly **one third** of concepts. They should:

- make the reader pause and introspect ("huh" moments)
- be experiential, not academic — point attention somewhere concrete
- never sound like guided meditation prompts ("Notice…", "Try to…")
- feel like a parting thought, not an assignment
- render **above** the collapsed **More** section (always visible)
